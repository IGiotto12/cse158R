PREDICTIONS on READ
1. Prepare the training data to build mappings and compute predictions.
2. Build User-Book Interaction and Book Popularity Maps
3. Measure the similarity between the target book and books the user has read through Jaccard Similarity
4. Combine Jaccard Similarity and Popularity for Predictions
5. Predict on pairs_Read.csv and write the results as either 1 or 0 into the prediction column


PREDICTIONS on RATING
1. Prepare the user-item interaction data for training the model and predicting ratings.
2. Create mappings of user and book IDs to indices for numerical operations.
3. Use the global average rating as a baseline for predictions and as a fallback for unseen users or books.
4. Initialize user and book biases to zero.
5. Divide the training data into a training set and a validation set.
6. Train the Model Using Stochastic Gradient Descent to minimize the error and select the best modal parameters.
7. Use the model parameters (biases and latent factors) that achieved the lowest validation MSE.
8. Predict on pairs_Rating.csv and save the results into the prediction column
